# Userverse

Userverse is an open-source platform designed to make managing users, organizations, and their relationships simple and efficient. It’s built for developers, communities, and organizations who want a free, flexible, and secure way to handle user and organization management without relying on closed or proprietary systems.

### Database
 - Database initialization, connection management, and session handling (engine setup, session factory)
### Logic
 - Services: Core business logic implementation (user registration, authentication flows)
 - Repositories: Data access layer for database operations with clean abstractions
### Middleware
 - Request/response processing components (CORS configuration, logging, error handlers)
### Models
 - Pydantic schema definitions for data validation and API documentation

### Routers
 - API endpoint definitions organized by resource domain (users, auth, etc.)

### Security
 - Authentication mechanisms and authorization controls (JWT, password hashing)
### Utils
 - Shared helper functions and third-party integrations (email, OTP generation)

### Docs
 - Technical documentation assets including diagrams and implementation guides

### Tests
 - Comprehensive test suite mirroring application structure for unit and integration testing

# 📘 Running the Userverse API

This project uses **FastAPI**, **Uvicorn**, and a dynamic configuration system with support for both CLI and hot-reload development.

---

## 🚀 Development Mode with Auto-Reload

Use `uvicorn` in **factory mode** to support reload and dynamic config loading via environment variables:

```bash
# Set environment variables and run the app
ENV=development JSON_CONFIG_PATH=config/dev.json \
uvicorn app.main:create_app --factory --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8500
```

✅ This supports live code reload and is ideal for development workflows.

---

## ⚙️ Production or CLI Mode (No Reload)

Use the built-in CLI to run the app with full control over config, port, and worker count:

```bash

uv run -m app.main --port 8500 \
  --env production \
  --config sample-config.json \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8500 \
  --workers 4
```

✅ This mode supports scaling with Uvicorn workers and does not enable reload.

## 📁 Config Example

Your JSON config should look like:

```json
{
  "environment": "development",
  "cor_origins": {
    "allowed": ["*"],
    "blocked": []
  },
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "Userverse",
  "description": "Backend API"
}
```
